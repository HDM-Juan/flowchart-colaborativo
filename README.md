# Flowchart Colaborativo

A collaborative flowchart application built with React and Vite, using Firebase for backend services.

## Development

This project uses React with Vite for fast development and hot module replacement (HMR).

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

## Firebase Deployment

This project is configured to deploy to Firebase Hosting. Before deploying, you **must** run the build command to generate the production files:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist/` folder with the production-ready files that Firebase Hosting will serve.

After building, you can deploy using:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

The Firebase configuration (`firebase.json`) is set up to:
- Serve files from the `dist/` directory
- Handle single-page application (SPA) routing by redirecting all routes to `index.html`

## Project Structure

- `/src` - React application source code
- `/dist` - Production build output (generated by `npm run build`)
- `/public` - Static assets
- `firebase.json` - Firebase Hosting configuration

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
